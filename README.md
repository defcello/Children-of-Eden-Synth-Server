===========

Earlier this year (2013), I participated in a production of "Children of Eden" which required 3 keyboardists and a vast array of instruments, often exotic, for them to switch around on.  Using some electronic pianos, a laptop, and a Roland Fantom XR, I wrote a Python program that would pipe the keyboards' MIDI events into different input channels of the Roland Fantom XR and would host a web server for the keyboardists to use the browser of a WiFi touchscreen device (e.g. tablet, smart phone, etc.) to select the instrument they wanted to play.  My next musical "Shrek the Musical" looks to have a similar situation.  Therefore, I'm opening this project to the public since others may be having similar situations.
